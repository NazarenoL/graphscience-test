<div class="box">
    <h2>Error!</h2>

    <div class="alert alert-error fade in">
        <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">&times;</button>
        <h4>An error has ocurred while creating the post. </h4>
        That was bad; My friend facebook said that it was because:<br />
        <?php echo $error;?>
    </div>
    <div class="clear"></div>
</div>
